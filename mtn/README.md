1. The first file is clean file

2. Secondly we implemented EDA.

3. Then we dropped all missing values without handling them, handled outliers and made 
a few quick feature importance tests with backward elemenation and LASSO methods.

4. After that we returned to original dataset and handled missing values, outliers, then dropped 
some columns by feature importance tests which we already exprienced in third step. 
So we acquired a golden data set. And implemented first models to golden data set to make initial 
assesments.
